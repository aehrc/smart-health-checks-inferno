      description %(
This test verifies resources returned from the first search conform to
the [Smart Health Checks Immunization](https://smartforms.csiro.au/ig/StructureDefinition/SHCImmunization).
If at least one resource from the first search is invalid, the test will fail.

It verifies the presence of mandatory elements and that elements with
required bindings contain appropriate values. CodeableConcept element
bindings will fail if none of their codings have a code/system belonging
to the bound ValueSet. Quantity, Coding, and code element bindings will
fail if their code/system are not found in the valueset.
