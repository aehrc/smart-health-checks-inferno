# Service Purpose

This teardown service provides cleanup functionality to remove test resources
that were created during the Smart Health Checks test suite execution. Since
Inferno does not have a built-in teardown mechanism, this service is implemented
as a test group to provide the necessary cleanup operations.

# Operation

The service identifies resources marked for deletion and performs cleanup
operations to maintain a clean testing environment and prevent resource
accumulation on the test server.

This service operation deletes test resources that were created during the
test suite execution. It processes candidate resources from the test session
and performs DELETE operations on the FHIR server to clean up the test
environment.

The service groups resources by type and processes deletions systematically,
logging progress and results for monitoring purposes.
